This is a library for parsing and writing Standard MIDI Files (SMFs)

The parser currently just outputs the data it finds and can be run with

    ./midi.py [midi-file]

write_midi.py is intended to be used as a library for generating MIDI files
and, while currently limited, can be seen in action in in_c/in_c2midi.py

There is also the player module that enables you to (on OS X) easily fire up a
MIDI player (e.g. QuickTime Player) to play a given sequence (say from the
interactive prompt) without having to explicitly save and open the file in a
player yourself.
